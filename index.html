                Hello! My name is Christoper Calvachi and I am from Quito, Ecuador. I am very excited to start my course here at BYU Idaho. I have been a web developer for 4 years and I work for a company called Lambdo, which is in Utah, USA.
                I love video games and movies, I am part of the community of video game developers here in Ecuador, we are in constant search of making Ecuador a power in the development of video games worldwide.
                I have a great love for the Jurassic Park movies, I enjoy building with LEGO, and my biggest passion is mountains.
                I'm married and I also have a deep taste for 80's and 90's rock.
            </p>
