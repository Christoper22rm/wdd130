    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this website is to allow people from all over the world
        to have easy access to information about the company and the services
        it provides. It is important to atract the most amount of customers, especially
        with a niche hobby that is white water rafting, and it will benefit us with new 
        oportunities to make business happen.       
    </p>
   

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Our target audience includes single adults and couples ranging from ages 20 - 38 that want 
        to experience the beautiful and exciting situations that rafting in nature has 
        to offer which can't be found anywhere else in the city. This kind of person should feel welcomed and willing to try rafting, thus
        it is important that the prices of our services and the look of our page aligns with it.
        Meaning the site should be aesthetically simple, utilize a limited pool of vibrant yet soft colors
        so that it is light on the eyes (preferably those related to nature, e.g. blue, green, etc. ), 
        with just enough text and images that the person focuses on the fun that can be found with rafting.
        It is expected that users will enter this site from both computers and mobile devices.
